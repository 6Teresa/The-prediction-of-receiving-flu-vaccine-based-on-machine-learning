# Flu Vaccination Prediction Model

## Overview
This project utilizes machine learning to predict the likelihood of individuals receiving H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccines. By integrating behavioral, attitudinal, and doctor recommendation features, we aim to improve prediction accuracy and explore the impact of various data analysis techniques on prediction outcomes.

## Dataset
The dataset comprises 35 features with missing values, split into training and test sets. Features include individual behaviors, attitudes towards vaccines, and doctor recommendations.

## Methodology
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Initial data inspection to understand distributions, correlations, and identify missing values.
- **Preprocessing**: Handling missing values and feature engineering to improve model input quality.
- **Classification**: Applying machine learning algorithms like Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines to predict vaccination likelihood.
